Hi,to use this project,run the django project on the machine that is going to be the host server,in the settings.py include the host mchines ip in the allowed_hosts array,then in the unity project,change every https://127.0.0.1 to the host machine's ip address,also make sure that
your firewall doesnt block any traffic from the unity app or the django app.the minimum players required to start a match is 2 players.if you want to change that,go to my_functions.py in utils directory,in 86th line,change the required amount to your desired value
this app also has news_system,authentication system,posting and commenting system and a simple shopping system,feel free to try them out.
also to create an admin user,simply write python manage.py createsuperuser to access the django's default admin panle.
